# The InCUBE dataset

The realization of BIM models, especially of historic and heritage assets (HBIM), is still resource-intensive and time-consuming due to the manual efforts required for data creation and enrichment. Improve 3D data processing, interoperability, and the automation of the BIM generation process are some of the trending research topics. For this, benchmark datasets are extremely helpful in evaluating newly developed algorithms and methodologies for these scopes. 
Within the activities of the EU project InCUBE (https://incubeproject.eu/) we have created a dataset with raw and processed data produced in the Italian demo site of the project (i.e. Santa Chiara district of Trento, Italy). 
The diversity of the shared data enables multiple possible uses, investigations and developments. The InCUBE dataset is available to the R&D community to develop and validate new solutions for:
- increasing automation in 3D data processing
- BIM (and Historical Building Information Modelling - HBIM) generation
- interoperability between different software
- simulation of energy efficiency processes (BEM)

### InCUBE project
InCUBE (https://incubeproject.eu/) envisions to unlock the EU renovation wave through cutting-edge standardised and integrated processes based on industrialisation, innovative renewable energy technologies, digitalisation, and new market entrants. All while accounting for social inclusion, gender mainstreaming and upskilling of current and protentional workforce. The solutions emerging from InCUBE will be validated in 3 large-scale demo sites: Zaragoza (Spain), Trento (Italy) and Groningen (Netherlands).
